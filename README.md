This is a simple React App which shows next parameters in selected city:
- current temperature
- current condition (rain, snow, shiny, etc.)
- % humidity
- forecast for 5 days with min\max temperature every day
- weather condition for next 5 days

Besides basic packages I downloaded using npm :
- fontAwesome (for nicer fonts)
- axios (for API call)
